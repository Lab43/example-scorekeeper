## What is Scorekeeper?

Scorekeeper is an example React/Redux app. It's an interactive scoreboard for keeping track of points in a game (though there's no real backend so don't expect your scores to be saved if you reload the page). The intention is for this to be a starting point for more advanced example apps, such as [this version with added undo/redo functionality](https://github.com/Lab43/scorekeeper-with-undo-and-redo).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages. You'll need to edit the homepage setting in package.json to reflect your GitHub username and repo name. [More information is available here.](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)
