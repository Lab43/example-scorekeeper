### Scorekeeper is an example React/Redux app.

[You can demo it here.](https://lab43.github.io/example-scorekeeper/)

The world is full of example todo apps, so I decided to make an interactive scoreboard instead. This app doesn't have a real backend, so each time you refresh it it will load the same sample data from a fake API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages. You'll need to edit the homepage setting in package.json to reflect your GitHub username and repo name. [More information is available here.](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)
